# Customer Behaviour Analysis

This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to help a retail company make better data-driven decisions. Using Python for data cleaning, SQL for data analysis, and Power BI for visualization, the project identifies patterns in spending, discounts, reviews, and demographics. The final outcome includes a cleaned dataset, SQL insights, and an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights key trends such as revenue by category, age group, and subscription status to support smarter marketing and sales strategies.
